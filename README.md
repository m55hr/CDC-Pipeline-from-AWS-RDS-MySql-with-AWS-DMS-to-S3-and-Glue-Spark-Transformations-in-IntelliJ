# CDC-Pipeline-from-AWS-RDS-MySql-with-AWS-DMS-to-S3-and-Glue-Spark-Transformations-in-IntelliJ
Data Pipeline: Integrating AWS DMS for MySQL to S3, Using AWS Glue Interactive Sessions with Spark Transformations in IntelliJ, and Implementing CDC Processing for Final Dataset Delivery
This project involves creating a comprehensive data pipeline to efficiently manage and process MySQL data using AWS services and advanced tools. We utilize AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) to perform full load and change data capture (CDC) from MySQL on AWS RDS to an S3 bucket in Parquet format. PySpark transformations are executed in AWS Glue Interactive Sessions, with development and testing conducted through IntelliJ IDEA. The final dataset, enriched through these transformations, is then saved to a designated S3 bucket for further use and analysis. This approach ensures robust data integration, transformation, and storage, leveraging the power of AWS and PySpark for optimal performance and scalability.
